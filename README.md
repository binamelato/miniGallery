# miniGallery

Unfinished mini gallery project.

What works:
- Uploading images from a directory
- Adjusting the image size to the gallery size
- Switching to full-screen mode by double-clicking, exiting this mode by pressing Esc/double-clicking the mouse
- Scroll to the next image to the left or right arrows
- Visually display the number of images in the gallery and change them
